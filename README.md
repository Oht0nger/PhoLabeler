# PhotonLabeler

**Version 1.0**

Software for visual interpretation and labeling of ICESat-2 Geolocated Photon data (ATL03)

![alt text](https://github.com/Oht0nger/PhoLabeler/blob/master/PhotonLabe.png?raw=true "PhotonLabeler UI")

**_PhotonLabeler_** is a free graphic user interface (GUI) for visualization and manual labeling of ICESat-2 Geolocated Photon data (ATL03) through visual interpretation. The software is developed with MATLAB AppDesigner (MATLAB R2020a +) and uses MATLAB functions to read and plot ATL03 Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files. To support manual labeling of points, the software provides the following:
1) Definition of different point classes i.e. a user can specify the name, code and color of a defined point class
2) Point selections tools (rectangle, polygon or polyline-based selection)
3) Geo-linking to high-resolution web maps to provide ancillary information during visual interpretation
4) Saving and loading of a labeling session i.e. a can saved a session and load it to continue the labeling task.
5) Saving of plot graphics to include in documents or presentations

**Installing PhotonLabeler**

**_PhotonLabeler_** is available as a compiled MATLAB binary which can be installed as a stand-alone software without a MATLAB license. The software does require MATLAB Runtime (free, 2.5Gb+) though, which can be downloaded and installed prior or during the installation of the software. For best performance, we recommend installing the software on a systems with 8 Gb + RAM with any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor with four logical cores or more.
